<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Playing with Dynamic Range&nbsp;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EMCCD cameras like the </span><a href="https://andor.oxinst.com/products/newton-ccd-and-emccd-cameras/newton-970"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andor Newton 970</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are among the most sensitive detectors in the world, capable of counting individual photons.&nbsp; Sensitivity to small signals is one important parameter, but to faithfully record a scene a detector must be able to capture both large signals and small signals.&nbsp; This capability is referred to as </span><strong>dynamic range</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and it is represented by the ratio of the biggest signal that can be captured to the smallest.&nbsp; Our eyes are capable of tremendous dynamic range that often surpasses the cameras we use - think of the difficulty in snapping a photo of a person against a daytime sky.&nbsp; If you set your camera&rsquo;s exposure to fit your subject&rsquo;s face, the sky behind is wildly saturated.&nbsp; Set your exposure to capture the details of the sky, and your subject becomes a silhouette.&nbsp; To capture both in a single shot requires high dynamic range, and maximizing dynamic range is critical in any application where bright and dim features coexist within a single measurement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what determines dynamic range?&nbsp; To return to the original loose definition above, it is the ratio of the biggest signal we can faithfully record to the smallest.&nbsp; What determines the biggest signal in a camera?&nbsp; Certainly the full well depth - the physical capacity of a pixel to hold photogenerated charges - sets an upper bound.&nbsp; Beyond the full well depth we can no longer capture additional light - see a further discussion </span><a href="https://andor.oxinst.com/learning/view/article/dynamic-range-and-full-well-capacity"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here in the Andor Learning Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp; All else being equal, physically larger pixels can hold more charge.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once converted to charge we also have to digitize our signals, so our photogenerated charges will pass through the additional bottleneck of the</span><a href="https://andor.oxinst.com/assets/uploads/andor-support-resources/FAQ063.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> analog to digital converter (ADC)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp; Simply put, we need to trade charges for bits (interchangeably called ADC counts, ADC units, ADUs) at some exchange rate (called the ADC gain), and only up to some maximum value determined by the </span><strong>ADC bit depth</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp; Typical ADCs will digitize charge over a range of 12, 16, or sometimes even 18 bits.&nbsp; This means we set a gain, for simplicity let&rsquo;s say 1 count per electron, and then let the ADC quantify the charge in a pixel from 0 to 2</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><sup>bit depth</sup></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or 0 to 2</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><sup>16</sup></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (65536) in the case of a 16-bit ADC.&nbsp; Not a problem until we reach 65537 electrons in a single pixel - our ADC will still output 65536 and our values will no longer match reality.&nbsp; Even though we may still have plenty of physical space in the pixel for photogenerated electrons, we have </span><strong>saturated our ADC</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and capped our dynamic range.&nbsp; At this point it may seem reasonable to simply up the gain and get 1 ADC &lsquo;count&rsquo; per 2 electrons - problem solved.&nbsp; Now we can digitize up to 2</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><sup>16</sup></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> * 2 electrons.&nbsp; However, we&rsquo;ve created a problem at the small signal end - we can no longer digitize a single electron accurately, as ADC counts only come in whole units.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see, ADC gain is an important factor in determining both sensitivity and dynamic range.&nbsp; Andor cameras like the </span><a href="https://andor.oxinst.com/products/newton-ccd-and-emccd-cameras/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newton</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://andor.oxinst.com/products/idus-spectroscopy-cameras/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">iDus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://andor.oxinst.com/products/ixon-emccd-cameras"><span style="font-weight: 400;">iXon </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">series have a user-selectable gain which allows measurement in high sensitivity and high dynamic range modes.&nbsp; As well, the importance of high ADC bit depth becomes clear.&nbsp; At lower bit depths, squeezing both bright and dim measurements into the range of possible ADC values becomes difficult, with either the high end cut off, or small changes at the low end rounded too heavily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An additional component of dynamic range is </span><strong>noise</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp; A very noisy detector, regardless of bit depth, gain and so on, can&rsquo;t faithfully detect signals smaller than the noise generated during a measurement.&nbsp; Discussion of different noise sources, and how to </span><a href="https://andor.oxinst.com/learning/view/article/ccd-signal-to-noise-ratio"><span style="font-weight: 400;">calculate signal to noise ratio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, can be found elsewhere in the learning center, but here we consider read noise, dark noise, and shot noise as a single value.&nbsp; EMCCDs like the iXon and Newton can virtually eliminate read noise, and </span><a href="https://andor.oxinst.com/learning/view/article/deep-vacuum-te-cooling-and-emccds"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deep cooling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can minimize dark noise, but some amount of noise will always remain.&nbsp; For example, trying to measure a single photogenerated electron when the sensor read noise is 2 electrons RMS is not going to work well - the real lower signal limit in this case is the noise floor, not our ability to capture light or digitally count charge.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below you&rsquo;ll find an interactive visualization that shows how these different parameters affect dynamic range.&nbsp; Two spectral peaks, peak A and peak B, are recorded on the sensor.&nbsp; On the left, the y axis is scaled to fit peak A, while on the right, the y axis is scaled to accommodate peak B.&nbsp; Overlaid are two lines, with the red line representing the pixel well depth, and the blue line representing ADC depth.&nbsp; When any signal exceeds the well depths, the pixel well is saturated and no further detection can occur.&nbsp; Likewise, if the gain (in ADC counts / electron) is too high relative to the signal, the ADC can saturate even if the pixel well depth hasn&rsquo;t been reached.&nbsp; A larger ADC bit depth will help avoid ADC saturation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By default this visualization shows an ideal noiseless camera with an ADC gain nicely matched to the well depth, allowing measurement over the pixel&rsquo;s full range with 16-bit depth with a dynamic range of 65,536:1.&nbsp; Try lowering the bit depth to 12 bits, and notice how the brighter signal A gets cut off.&nbsp; As well, our calculated dynamic range has dropped to 4096:1.&nbsp; At 12 bits and 1.5 electrons / ADU, we&rsquo;re unsuccessfully trying to cover a range of 0 to 100,000 electrons, or 0 to ~65,000 counts at this gain setting.&nbsp; To compensate we can adjust our gain to require more electrons to generate an ADC count - in this case 25 e</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">/ADU.&nbsp; Now our capability to measure bright signals has been restored, but our dynamic range is unchanged at 4096:1.&nbsp; You can see that our formerly smooth small signal is now blocky and aliased; we&rsquo;ve sacrificed some of our small-signal fidelity with this new gain setting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, try increasing the noise parameter to the maximum of 100 e</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> RMS.&nbsp; Our dynamic range has dropped to 1000:1 and our small signal is nearly lost in the noise.&nbsp; Changing to a more sensitive gain won&rsquo;t help, instead it will just capture our noise at a higher resolution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see, finding the optimal camera and measurement strategy for your measurement can be challenging - we would welcome the opportunity to discuss your specific application.</span></p>
